#### Bienvenido a los Dashboards de mantenimiento

Este es el proyecto base para la visualización de datos del Departamento de Mantenimiento


This is a community-supported project designed for people new to Plotly and Dash. It contains minimal sample apps with ~100 lines of code to demonstrate basic usage of graphs, components, callbacks, and layout design. 

For access to our newsletter that includes cheat sheets, tips and tricks, community apps, and deep dives into the Dash architecture, [join Dash Club](https://go.plotly.com/dash-club).

If you have any suggestions for improvements, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-app-gallery/issues).
If you would like to contribute your own app, checkout the [contributing guide](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-app-gallery/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
