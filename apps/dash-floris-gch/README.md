## Downloading and running a single app

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/releases) and download and `unzip` the app you want. Then `cd` into the app directory and install its dependencies in a virtual environment in the following way:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: \venv\scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then run the app:
```bash
python app.py
```
